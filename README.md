# DecentiFAI
DecentiFAI is a JavaScript framework to allow for easy decentralized (federated) learning in a peer-to-peer fashion over WebRTC. Using the Y.js CRDT implementation, we have a robust, shared data space in which to effectively distribute parameters and aggregate learning. All without requiring any centralization whatsoever.
